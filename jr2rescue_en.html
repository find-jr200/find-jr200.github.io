<h1>JR2Rescue</h1>

<p>&nbsp;JR2Rescue is free software that converts WAV files recorded with 
programs on JR-200 to CJR format and other formats.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Operation Environment : Version 0.5.1 and later .net Framework 4.7.2 
		and later / Version 0.4.2 and older .net Framework 3.5 and later </li>
		<li>Readable WAV file : sampling frequency 22kHz-48kHz, quantize 8bit or 16bit, 
		channel 1 or 2.&nbsp; liner PCM only.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*<strong> </strong>This program has not been fully tested. I do not intend to have 
	a harmful effect on the user environment, but I will not compensate for any 
	damage. Please use it after understanding.</p>

<h4>* Latest Version 0.5.1</h4>
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/find-jr200/JR2Rescue/blob/main/JR2Rescue0_5_1.zip">https://github.com/find-jr200/JR2Rescue/blob/main/JR2Rescue0_5_1.zip</a> (204KB)</p>
	<h4>Update Histry</h4>
	<p>2025.1.4 JR2Rescue 0.6.1 <strong>* Publication has been temporarily 
	suspended while a bug is being fixed.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>added WAV to JR2 conversion in WAV to CJR tab. This feature is for running tmq special 
		format tapes.</li>
		<li>removed 22KHz WAV creation function in JR2 to WAV tab (because the 
		frequency shift is large at 22kHz)</li>
		<li>added &quot;Overwrite BaudRate Byte&quot; checkbox in CJR to JR2 tab. Turn 
		this off only when adding tmq special format. <strong>Furthermore, the special 
		format can only be read at 600 baud by VJR-200. It cannot be read at 
		2400baud.</strong></li>
	</ul>

<h3>File Composition</h3>

	English environment, remove this folder</strong>.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<h3>1. WAV to CJR</h3>

<p>&nbsp; Convert wav file to CJR, BIN, JR2 format.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="362" src="images/jr2r_1en.png" width="497"></p>
	<p>1. Specify the input WAV file, output format, Model and press "Read WAV". If the dialog 
	"failed" appears, WAV analysis has failed, so try changing the saturation 
	and threshold levels.</p>
	<p>2. If "Read WAV" is successful, the "Write File" button will be enabled. 
	Select the output format and click the "Write File" button. You can also 
	write different formats in quick succession.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>* The JR2 format can also be used with regular formats, but it does not 
	check whether the checksums match, so it is recommended to use it only with 
	special format tapes. Even if a dialog saying &quot;Conversion completed 
	successfully&quot; appears after converting to JR2, it does not necessarily mean 
	that the file can be loaded correctly.</p>
	<p><a href="aboutjr2format_en.html">About JR2 format</a></p>
	<p><strong>the special format can only be read at 600 baud by VJR-200. It 
	cannot be read at 2400baud.</strong></p>
	<p>* Fixed to 2400 baoud(CJR)</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Please be sure to check this before use. If baud rate of the CJR 
	file is set to 600 baud, it cannot be loaded with Virtual Panasonic JR200U. 
	Uncheck this only if you want to create a CJR with 600 baud specified for 
	special reasons, or if you have a special format that does not have a baud 
	rate specified.</p>
	<p>* Wave Adjustment(JR2)</p>
	<p>&nbsp; It correct the loaded waveform to be 1200Hz or 2400Hz. Normally, 
	you should convert it with it checked, but if it does not load correctly, 
	try unchecking it.</p>

<h3>2. CJR to WAV</h3>

<p>&nbsp; Convert CJR file to WAV file.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="362" src="images/jr2r_2en.png" width="497"></p>
	<p>Please specify the source file as the input CJR file and the output file 
	as the WAV file, select 600baud / 
	2400baud , PCM formats and press "Convert to WAV"</p>

<h3>3. JR2toWAV</h3>
	<p>Convert JR2 to WAV</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="362" src="images/jr2r_3en.png" width="497"></p>
	<p><strong>*CAUTION*</strong></p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp; JR2 files created with the WAV to JR2 function cannot be 
	converted back to WAV. This is because loud noises may be recorded, and 
	playing them back may damage speakers or your hearing.</strong></p>
	<p>Please specify the input file as the input CJR file and the output file 
	as the WAV file and PCM formats, press "Convert to WAV"</p>
	<p>* Blank Expansion</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If the converted wav file cannot be loaded properly due to 
	insufficient blanks, please check &quot;Blank Expansion&quot;. The blank between the 
	program and data will be approximately 5 seconds (if the original blank is 
	longer than that, it will remain as is). However, if the original JR2 file 
	was created without blanks, it will not be expanded even if you check &quot;Blank 
	Expansion&quot;. In that case, please recreate the JR2 file with blanks.</p>

	<h3>4. CJR to JR2</h3>
	<p>&nbsp; Convert CJR file to JR2 file.</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="362" src="images/jr2r_4en.png" width="497"></p>
	<p>* What's JR2 Format</p>
	<p>&nbsp;See <a href="aboutjr2format_en.html">about JR2 Format</a></p>
	<p>* About output file</p>
	<p>When you specify a file that exist, append to the end.</p>
	<p>When you specify a file that does not exist, create new file.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If you want to create a new one, enter the full path in the text 
	box directly, or press "Browse" to select a folder and enter the file name 
	to create in the file name box.</p>
	<p>* Add blank</p>
	<p>&nbsp; "Add blank" is necessary for those that cannot be loaded normally 
	without adding a blank (e.g. Swashbuckler) .&nbsp; When you convert these 
	games to JR2 format, specify at least 1000 to 1500 bytes or more blanks.</p>
	<p>* About Baud Rate</p>
	<p>&nbsp; For normal format tapes, there is no difference in accuracy 
	between 600 baud and 2400 baud as long as JR2 files are read by the VJR-200, 
	so there is no advantage to choosing 600 baud except for special 
	experimental purposes.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; <strong>However, for some special format software 2400 baud will 
	cause a loading error, so it is necessary to create it at 600 baud.</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp; The &quot;Overwrite BaudRate Byte&quot; ON/OFF function is only used when 
	adding a special format CJR. Normal CJRs are turned on and the baud rate 
	specification byte (24th byte of the header block) is rewritten to the 
	specified baud rate, but if a special CJR without a header block is 
	rewritten, the data will be destroyed, so turn this function off.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Normally, be sure to check &quot;Overwrite BaudRate Byte&quot; before use.&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>5. Multi CJR</h3>
	<p>* What's Multi CJR</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Multi CJR file is the file which merge separated area (e.g. text 
	vram and attribute vram, machine language and user defined character area). 
	<span class="auto-style1">However, you can't merge BASIC program (SAVEd file) and Machine 
	Language(MSAVEd file)</span>. You can only merge MSAVEd files.</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="362" src="images/jr2r_5en.png" width="497"></p>
	<p>1. Drag and drop the MSAVE CJR file to the list box. To delete a file, 
	select it and press the Delete key. You can drop multiple files, but a BASIC 
	file (=saved file) will result in an error when writing.</p>
	<p>2. Specify the multi CJR file name and JR file name, and then click Write 
	Multi CJR File.</p>
	<h3>6. etc</h3>

<p>1. Convert memory image file to BASIC CJR file.</p>

<p>2. Convert BIN file to CJR file.</p>
