	<p>4. &quot;File - Save CJR&quot; menu has been removed.</p>
	<h2 id="Preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>1. &nbsp;Extract ROM and font from actual machine.</p>
<p>MSAVE "ROM1",$A000,$BFFF (file size 8192byte)<br>
MSAVE "ROM2",$E000,$FFFF (file size 8192byte)<br>
MSAVE "FONT",$D000,$D7FF (file size 2048byte)</p>
	<p>If you have a FDD system</p>
	<p>MSAVE "CAS1:FDDROM",$D800,$DFFF (file size 2048byte)</p>
<p>Please convert it to BIN file with JR2Rescue.</p>
	<p>* JR2Rescue is free software that converts WAV files recorded with 
	programs on JR-200 to CJR format and other formats. Download is
	<a href="jr2rescue_en.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please check that the file size is correct. Since it checks the file size, it 
can not be registered unless it is incorrect.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Merge ROM files.</p>
<p>COPY /B ROM1.BIN+ROM2.BIN ROM.BIN</p>
<p>&nbsp; It does not work if the order of combining is reversed. Check the file 
size after joining should be 16384 bytes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Visual C++ 2015 - 2022 redistributable 
package is required. Please install it if not installed.</p>
	<p>32bit runtime <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe">

	<h2 id="Execution">Execution</h2>
<p>1. Extract vjr200_xxx.zip and place VJR200.exe, VJR200_jp. dll, 
	VJR200_en.dll in the same folder. Even if you only use English, VJR 
	200_en.dll is necessary. It will not work with VJR 200.exe alone.</p>
	<p>VJR200.exe&nbsp; Executable file<br>VJR200_jp.dll&nbsp; Japanese 
	resource file<br>
	VJR200_en.dll&nbsp; English resource file</p>
	<p>&nbsp; You can create a folder under Program Files, but other place may 
	be better. By the way, the setting file is placed under 
	<span style="font-family:SEGOE UI">AppData\local\FIND_JR\VJR-200\</span> of the user folder.</p>
<p>2. When starting for the first time, ROM and font file are not 
	set, so this screen will appear.</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="324" src="images/init_en.png" width="400"></p>
<p>3. Set each file in [Tool] - [ROM, FONT file setting] dialog, 
	end VJR-200 once and re-execute.</p>
	<p>4. For English keyboard, please change [Option - Emulator - keyboard] 
	setting to English.</p>

<h3>File</h3>
	<h4>Mount CJR, JR2</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Mount the CJR or JR2 file.</p>
	<p>* What's JR2 Format</p>
	<p>See <a href="aboutjr2format_en.html">about JR2 Format</a></p>
	<h4>Quick Load CJR</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Please be careful as this is a dangerous feature. BASIC, Machine 
	language files are written directly to memory. Therefore, although it ends 
	in a moment, inconvenience may occur because it writes to the thing which it 
	was executing so far. It is recommended to reset before using. Also, you can 
	not use it when executing LOAD from the program (many commercial products 
	for JR-200U).</p>
	<p>It is possible to use LOAD, MLOAD manually as a possible case. Multiple 
	LOAD, MLOAD can be executed repeatedly.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; As a common failure, if you manipulate the menu without Ready 
	immediately after resetting, you will not be able to execute it properly 
	because it reads in the state that initialization of JR-200 is not 
	finished.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp; CJR files can also be dragged and dropped. You can drop up to 10 
	files at the same time, all files are "Quick Loaded".</p>
	<del>
	</del>
	<h4>Unmount</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Unmount the CJR and JR2 files.</p>
	<h4>New JR2 file</h4>
	<p>Create a new JR2 file.</p>
	<h4>JR2 Next<br>JR2 Prev</h4>
	<p>Cue the next or previous program, data. Only JR2 file is valid.</p>
	<p>* NOTICE * It may not be possible to cue with special format files.</p>
	<h4>Go to Top</h4>
	<p>Move to the beginning of the tape. Both CJR and JR 2 are valid.</p>
	<h4>Printer Page Feed</h4>
	<p>When the printer output is set to PNG and "automatic page feed" is turned 
	off, it is manually output as page feed = PNG file. If nothing is printed, 
	it will not be output.</p>
	<h4>Quick Type</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; It reads a text file containing BASIC code and automatically 
	inputs it to the emulator. Automatically maximizes the CPU clock only while 
	it is being input and returns to its original state when finished. Up to 
	65536 bytes of text file can be read. To stop inputting in the middle, press 
	Esc.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If you get an error during input, please slow down "quick type 
	speed" in option dialog.</p>
	<h4>Save Memory Image</h4>
	<p>Write the image of the memory in the document folder with the name 
	"dump.bin".</p>
	<h4>Load Debugging Label File</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Load the definition file for converting the address displayed in 
	the disassembe window into a string. The file must be created in the 
	following format.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Label Name (within 20 chars)</td>
			<td>One or more spaces or tabs</td>
			<td>Address (Hex 0 - FFFF, without "0x")</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>KEY_SCAN</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>e8cb</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CLS</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>ec7f</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
	<h4>Save State, Load State</h4>
	<p>&nbsp;State saves are saved in association with files only when the FDD 
	system is disabled and tape-compatible files (CJR, JR2) are mounted.&nbsp; 
	Up to 9 state files while mounting the file abc.cjr are saved in the same 
	folder with the name abc.cjr_0.sta.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp; State data for other states (no mounted tape support file or FDD 
	system enabled) is saved under 
	<span style="font-family:SEGOE UI">AppData\local\FIND_JR\VJR-200\</span> 
	with a name such as nomount_0.sta.&nbsp; It is 
	worth noting that all state savings when using "Quick Load" share data 
	without mounting. If you want to divide the state file for each game, please 
	mount -&gt; LOAD, MLOAD without using Quick loading. If you need more than two 
	files, we recommend that you convert it to JR2 (CJR changes the file to be 
	linked depending on load order).</p>
	<h4>Recent Files</h4>
	<p>The first ten pieces show the files used in "Mount CJR, JR2", the last 
	ten pieces show the files used in "Quick Load CJR".</p>

<h3>FDD</h3>
	<h4>Disk Image</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Select the D20 file and assign the image to two drives. To boot 
	DISK BASIC, assign the system disk to drive 1 and reset VJR-200 
	([File]-[Reset]).</p>
	<p>* D20 files have the same format as D88 files.</p>
	<h4>Detach FDD System</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; If the VJR-200 has an FDD expansion ROM file registered, it will 
	try to boot from the FD assuming that the FDD system is connected. Check 
	this and reboot if you want to boot with the main unit's ROM BASIC while 
	registering the expansion ROM.</p>
	<h3>View</h3>
	<h4>1x - 5x</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Change window size.</p>
	<h4>Full Screen</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; It displays in full screen. To cancel full screen Alt + Enter or 
	double click.</p>
	<h4>Square Pixel, Video Output Aspect</h4>
	<p>
	&nbsp; Since the width of the video output of the JR-200 actual machine has 
	been reduced by 15%, it is "Video Output Aspect" to reproduce it. However, 
	pixels may not be integral multiples, which makes it difficult to see. It is 
	recommended to use 3 times or full screen with smoothing.</p>
	<h4>Smoothing</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Sets whether or not to smooth.</p>
	<h4>Rotate</h4>
	<p>&nbsp;rorate screen 90, 180, 270 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
	<h4>Printer LED, Status Bar</h4>
	<p>Sets whether or not to display printer LED icon, status bar.</p>
	<h3>Tool</h3>
	<h4>Graph Keyboard</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Displays a virtual keyboard for entering graph characters.</p>
	<h4>Romaji Kana Input</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; During Katakana mode, "Romaji to Katakana transfer input"&nbsp; is enabled. 
	However, when the program acquires the character code of Katakana with 
	real-time key scan (PICK, STICK), it will not operate properly. In that case 
	please input usual Katakana.</p>
	<h4>Macro</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Up to 10 fixed phrases can be registered and entered by pressing 
	the keys 1, 2, 3, ...... 9, 0 (numeric keypad not allowed) or by 
	double-clicking on an item. The return key is represented by <span style="font-family:SEGOE UI">\r</span> and multiple 
	lines can be entered(max 80 characters).</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="276" src="images/macro_en.png" width="427"></p>
	<h4>Forced Joystick Mode</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Make it possible to operate games that only support keyboard 
	operation with the joypad. Specifically, it converts the input of the joypad 
	on Windows to the cursor key and up to two keys (space key, X, Z, etc.) 
	input. Therefore, it is not practical to use software that uses three or 
	more keys in addition to the cursor keys. Please note that not all games can 
	be operated.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Before using this mode, you first need to assign the appropriate 
	Joypad buttons to the A and B buttons in the Joypad settings. For the method 
	of key assignment, refer to option dialog - joypad item.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Turning on forced joystick mode is not saved (key assignments are 
	saved). Please set it each time it starts up.</p>
	<h4>Debug Window</h4>
	<p><img alt="" height="468" src="images/debugw.png" width="670">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;* Previously, you had to press SET when setting a breakpoint, but 
	since versioin 1.4.1, changes are automatically applied when you change the 
	checkbox or press Enter in the edit box (i.e. when the focus is moved).</p>
	<h5>Break Point</h5>
	<p>&nbsp;You can step by step while displaying the contents of the 
	registers of the CPU and peripheral chip MN1271. You can also set 
	breakpoints. You can temporarily disable a breakpoint by unchecking the 
	checkbox to the right of the edit box.</p>
	<p>* A breakpoint cannot be set on the next instruction of CLI or SEI. This 
	is by design.</p>
	<h5>&nbsp;IRQ</h5>
	<p>&nbsp;At the bottom IRQ, you can specify whether to generate TCA - TCF 
	IRQ during step execution. If you uncheck it, IRQ will not occur only during 
	step execution. However, even if IRQ is checked, interrupt processing will 
	not be executed unless the interrupt flag($C81E - $C81F) is set.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Even if the debug window is opened, this specification has no 
	effect during normal execution.</p>
	<h5>Read/Write Break</h5>
	<p>&nbsp; When the specified address (range specification is possible) is 
	read/written, it breaks. The address of the read/write instruction is 
	displayed in "Break Address". "R/W Address" has "R" for Read and "W" for 
	Write after the address.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Check the "R" checkbox if you want to break when reading, and 
	check the "W" checkbox if you want to break when writing.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Specify the range as follows: A &lt; B</p>
	<p>

	<h5>Watch</h5>
	<p>&nbsp;&quot;Watch&quot; displays 1-byte or 2-byte area in list form. However, the 
	value of the watch only changes when stopping at a breakpoint or when you 
	press the step execution. Therefore, the value may not match the constantly 
	updated memory window.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If you want to delete a watching item, right click and select 
	context menu &quot;Delete&quot;, or select the item and press 
	delete key.</p>
	<h5>Jump History</h5>
	<p>Display the jump history. For NMI and IRQ, "i" is displayed to the right 
	of the address.</p>
	<h4>Memory Window</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Display the memory contents in real time.</p>
	<h4>Disassemble Window</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Disassemble and display the code of the execution position. You

	<p>&nbsp; Sometimes things like NA (***) are displayed in mnemonic. Although this is an undefined area of ​​MN1800A in terms of 
	specification, it is inferred that it is actually executed as an instruction 
	in parentheses. Since it is a personal analysis to the last, there is a 
	possibility of being wrong.</p>
	<h4>FPS, CPU Speed</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Display FPS and CPU speed in the title bar.</p>
	<h4>Set ROM, Font Files</h4>
	<p>&nbsp; Specify the ROM file and Font file required for execution.&nbsp; 
	If you have a FDD system, specify FDD expansion ROM.</p>
	<h4>Option</h4>
	<p><img alt="" height="414" src="images/option_emu_en.png" width="328"></p>
	<p>* Language</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Switch the menu and message language to Japanese or English. In 
	the case of Auto, only Japan is Japanese according to user locale ID (LCID), 
	otherwise it is English.</p>
	<p>* Keyboard</p>
	<p>&nbsp; For English keyboard, please change [Option - Emulator - keyboard] 
	setting to English.</p>
	<p>* Refresh Rate</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Because the VJR-200 operates with reference to VSYNC, if the 
	vertical synchronization frequency can not be correctly acquired, the 
	execution speed will be out of order. In that case, uncheck the automatic 
	setting and manually set it.</p>
	<p>* Quick Type Speed</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Quick type Input speed can be set from 10ms to 100ms. Please delay 
	it if an error occurs.</p>
	<p>* Raise clock only when SAVE, LOAD</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Only when SAVE and LOAD, CPU clock is set to 1000% so that it can 
	process at high speed. When finished, it returns to the original clock.<br>&nbsp;From 
	V1.8.1, to avoid swashbuckler load errors, enabling this option will reduce 
	the clock consumption of each 6800 instruction by 2 clocks per instruction 
	only during SAVE and LOAD.</p>
	<p>* When recording stops, blank is added (JR2; Required or PRINT#)</p>
	<p>&nbsp; When recording to the JR2 format, 500 byte blank is added every 
	time a stop command is issued to the remote terminal. This is necessary to 
	successfully read PRINT# data. You can uncheck it if you do not use PRINT#. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="414" src="images/option_sys_en.png" width="328"></p>
	<p>* CPU Clock</p>
	<p>&nbsp; You can specify from 50% to 1000%. There may be inconvenience if 
	you change too much.</p>
	<p>* RAM Expansion</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If you change the ROM of $ A000 to $ BFFF to RAM, it will be in 
	the same state as when MON was executed.</p>
	<p>* RAM Initial Pattern</p>
	<p>　RAM Initial pattern can be selected from the following two types.</p>
	<p>(1) FF FF 00 00 FF FF 00 00</p>
	<p>Repeat "FF FF 00 00 FF FF 00 00" and "00 00 FF FF 00 00 FF FF" every 256 
	bytes from address n000.</p>
	<p>(2) 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF</p>
	<p>Repeat "00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF" and "FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00" every 128 
	bytes from address n000.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="414" src="images/option_snd_en.png" width="328"></p>
	<p>* Stereo Balance</p>
	<p>&nbsp; You can set left and right pan for each channel. Since TCF is used 
	for SOUND statement and warning sound, it is recommended to set it to the 
	center and set the TCC and TCD to swing left and right.</p>
	<p>* Buffer Write Interval</p>
	<p>&nbsp; You can specify the writing interval of DirectSound buffer from 
	1/100s to 1/50s. The initial value is 1/60s. The smaller the value, the 
	smaller the delay, but depending on the environment the operation may become 
	unstable or abnormally terminate.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; If it does not start normally, delete vjr200.ini (if it exists) and vjr200.xml
	<span style="font-family:SEGOE UI">	 in	 (user 
	folder)\AppData\Local\FIND_JR\VJR 200\</span> (all settings are initialized). Or 
	delete vjr200.ini (if it exists) and change the following item in vjr200.xml</p>
	<p>&lt;SBufferWriteInterval&gt;60&lt;/SBufferWriteInterval&gt;</p>
	<p>* Background Play</p>
	<p>&nbsp;It continues playing even when the window becomes inactive.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	<p>
	* Output</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; When set to RAW, data written to the printer output port is output 
	without being filtered.</p>
	<p>
	* Maker</p>
	<p>
	Set the printer model. Valid only for RAW output.</p>
	<p>
	* Auto Page Feed (PNG only)</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; In the case of PNG output, when there is no data output for 500 ms, 
	judge it to end and page forward to output PNG file. Then, if problems 
	occur, or if you want to group hard copies and lists into one image, uncheck 
	and manually page forward with [File] - [Printer Page Feed].</p>

	<p>
	* Button mode</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; It is recommended that you set it to 1 button except when using 
	software corresponding to 2 buttons.</p>
	<p>
	* Button Assignment</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; It does not need to be set when using with 1 button.</p>
	<p>
	* Forced joystick mode</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; When using this mode, you need to assign appropriate Joypad buttons 
	to A and B buttons of 1P in the Joypad setting. Button mode itself may be 
	left as 1 button.</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; After assigning, press the A button on the dialog and press the key 
	on the keyboard you wish to assign. Next, register the B button in the same 
	way.</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; Forced joystick mode works the same way even if button mode is 1 
	button or 2 buttons.</p>
