<h1>VJR-200 for Android</h1>
	<p>&nbsp; VJR-200 for Android is an emulator of Panasonic JR-200 (Japanese 
	model). However, some of JR-200U software work with VJR-200. English menu 
	and message are available.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; VJR-200 for Windows is <a href="vjr200_en.html">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>&nbsp; JR-200 emulator running on Android 4.1 to 10 (Android 4.4 or 
	above is 
	recommended).It doesn't work on Android 11.<br>The vertical screen is intended to be used alone, the 
	horizontal screen is intended to be used in combination with an external 
	keyboard, or used for games.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Operation Environment</h3>
	<p>&nbsp; Android 4.1 to 10 (confirmed with version 4.4, 5.1, 6.0, 10.0 on the actual device)</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Below Android 4.4, some functions may be limited, and performance 
	may be degraded in game mode.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Permission for installation or execution is storage read/write and 
	vibration and audio recording. If you refuse storage read/write, you cannot execute. 
	Unless you use Direct Player, you can refuse audio recording.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; The update simply installs over the new apk file. Settings should 
	be inherited as they are.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Compatible with Bluetooth and USB external keyboards (Japanese 
	keyboard only). If you are having difficulty entering, try changing the 
	Japanese input software (Google Japanese Input -&gt; Gboard, etc.).</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Not compatible with game controllers.&nbsp;</p>

	<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
	<p>&nbsp; Prepare the ROM and font files and transfer them to your 
	smartphone along with the CJR and JR2 files you want to execute. As there 
	are restrictions on the transfer destination, refer to the notes.</p>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>&nbsp;When you first start up, the white screen appears because the ROM 
		and font files are not set.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Select "File Setting" from the menu, set each file in the dialog, 
		then kill the task once and restart.<br>By the way, the "data directory" 
		is the save destination when SAVE or MSAVE, and the directory that opens 
		first in the file dialog.</li>
		<li>When the JR-200 startup screen appears, as you like it.</li>
	</ol>
<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
	<p><img alt="" height="400" src="images/VJR200a_menu_en.png" width="371"></p>
	<p>&nbsp; Unlike the Windows version, the BREAK key when using an external 
	keyboard is assigned to F11. This is because the Esc key has been used by 
	the OS. </p>
	<p>&nbsp; If you have a type that can be switched for each OS, such as a 
	Bluetooth keyboard, try using Windows settings. With the Android settings, 
	the operation of the function keys may not be what you intended.</p>
	<p>* * * * *</p>
	<p>VJR-200 for Android has 4 modes. Each transition is as follows.</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="376" src="images/vjr200a_mode_en.png" width="650"></p>
	<h2 id="directplayer">Direct Player</h2>

	<p>
	<img alt="" class="auto-style8" height="400" src="images/directplayer_en.png" style="float: left" width="189"> 
	Direct Player is a utility that can play CJR and JR2 files directly without 
	converting them to WAV files. It has nothing to do with the emulator.</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; <strong>To use the direct player, you must give it the permission of "Record Voice"</strong>. This is the permission 
	to display the 
	playback waveform (Visualizer), not to record your sound of life.</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp; Be sure to try setting the volume to maximum. It seems that there are 
	still many models that cannot obtain the required volume, but in that case, 
	there is no choice but to use a headphone amplifier.</p>
	<p>
	Turn on Blank Extension to extend the blanks recorded in the JR2 file to 5 
	seconds. Use this when a blank recorded in advance cannot be loaded 
	normally. However, it cannot be expanded unless blanks are recorded in the 
	original file. In that case, recreate the JR2 file.</p>
	<p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>For Android 4.4 or above, JR2 files placed on the SD card are 
		read-only (no problem because CJR cannot be added from the beginning). 
		Depending on the model, some may be read-only even if it is less than 
		4.3 (it will be displayed when mounting).</li>
		<li>It is not possible to save the state while mounting CJR, JR2 on the 
		SD card because the state file cannot be created in the same directory.</li>
		<li>I recommend deploying the files in the internal storage.</li>
		<li><strong>If you dismiss the activity with "Back", the emulator will be 
		reset and not restored</strong>. This is because if you use "Back", the 
		onSaveInstance and onRestoreInstance events do not occur. If you want to 
		restore, use "Home" or "Task History". </li>
